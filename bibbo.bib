abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising technique for wireless system due to its high spectral efficiency and its capability to counteract frequency selective fading channels. However, OFDM system is highly vulnerable to timing offset. This study proposes a novel timing estimation algorithm for downlink OFDM systems. A novel training sequence structure using Chu sequence is proposed. A new property of the inverse discrete Fourier transform of Chu sequence is derived. This property is used to obtain channel impulse response to estimate start of the OFDM symbol. The mean square error and timing detection performance of the proposed algorithm are shown to be better than the existing methods.},

@article{Manikandan2012,
abstract = {This paper deals with the determination of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) channel split ratio for time division duplex (TDD) based long term evolution (LTE) networks. In a TDD system, UL and DL transmissions are carried out at different time intervals, but share the same frequency band. The TDD framing in LTE is adaptive in the sense that the DL to UL bandwidth ratio may vary with time. This paper proposes an adaptive split ratio (ASR) scheme for LTE networks to automatically adjust the bandwidth ratio of DL to UL, according to the current traffic profile, wireless interference, and transport layer parameters. This provides the maximum aggregate throughput in LTE systems. The performance analysis shows that ASR scheme outperforms static allocation in terms of higher aggregate throughput and better adaptively to network dynamics. Further, it is also observed that the ASR scheme performs well for LTE, compared to worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) system. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2011.},

@article{Rajkumar2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. In this paper, optimum combining technique is applied to minimize the effect of Narrowband Interference (NBI) in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing based full duplex relay network. The NBI signal is assumed to be quasi-static over the duration of a transmitted signal. Multiple antennas are employed at Decode and Forward relay and destination nodes. The Probability Density Function of Signal to Interference Ratio at relay and destination nodes is derived using Hotelling's T 2 distribution. Analytical expression for the end-to-end outage probability of the proposed network is derived using the hypergeometric functions. As the weight vector of the optimal combiner is determined using the statistics of the interference channels, the performance of the proposed network becomes better than the network with maximal ratio combining.},

@article{Maheswari2017,
abstract = {The filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM) is one of the alternative modulation schemes to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing for next generation broadband wireless access systems. The non-linearity of high-power amplifiers (HPA) has a crucial effect on the performance of FBMC systems. In this study, the impacts of non-linear distortion effects are considered in a FBMC-OQAM system when the signal is passed through a HPA for medium- and high-power signals which are modelled as amplitude and phase distortions. Specifically, memory-less HPA non-linear distortion models such as solid-state power amplifier (SSPA), soft-envelope limiter (SEL), travelling wave tube amplifier are proposed for FBMC systems. A closed-form expression for bit error rate expression is derived and analysed for SSPA and SEL models for FBMC/OQAM system with non-linear HPA in frequency-selective Rayleigh channel by varying constellation size in OQAM modulation and input back-off. The performance is compared for the models with 64 sub-channels and input back-off for 6 and 8 dB. In lieu of validating the obtained simulation results, theoretical results are being compared.},
